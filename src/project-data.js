Working with softwares like Photoshop and XD for the first time taught me a lot about the workflow and organizational skills required to operate in a web development environment. I found myself organizing my elements in these programs like I would organize my code, which helped me simplify the building of the website later on. Additionally, organizing my work into functional components in XD translated well to building functional components in React, and gave me a good \'jumping off point\' for moving from a design to development environment.',
